    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <p>
     I am a postgraduate researcher in computational biology at Queen Mary University of London and Barts Cancer Institute specialising in the study of cancer evolution. My research lies at the intersection of mathematics and biology, incorporating computer simulations, statistics, large-scale data analysis and image processing to study the evolution of cancer, and in particular the impact of early cancer evolution on tumourigenesis, the development of intratumour heterogeneity, and treatment response. My current research focusses on deciphering the role of extrachromosomal DNA in driving cancer progression, oncogene amplification and treatment resistance. I am experienced in the use of programming languages such as C/C++, Python, Julia, R, HTML and BASH.<br><br>

In 2018 I earned a 1st class Master’s degree in theoretical physics at The University of Edinburgh. During this time my curiosity for computational research led to several successful collaborations through which I developed strengths in stochastic modelling, Monte-Carlo simulations, statistics and numerical integration. For my Master’s thesis, entitled “Stochastic Modelling of the Chemotherapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme”, I used computational modelling to study the interplay between DNA repair molecules and chemotherapeutic agents in brain tumours.
