     I am a postgraduate researcher in computational biology at Queen Mary University of London and Barts Cancer Institute specialising in the study of cancer evolution. My research lies at the intersection of mathematics and biology, incorporating computer simulations, statistics, large-scale data analysis and image processing to study the evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancers and the regenerative properties of the human liver. I am keen to apply my programming skills to develop new software for both academic and industrial applications.

In 2018 I earned a 1st class Master’s degree in theoretical physics at The University of Edinburgh. During this time my curiosity for computational research led to several successful collaborations through which I developed strengths in stochastic modelling, Monte-Carlo simulations, statistics and numerical integration. For my Master’s thesis, entitled “Stochastic Modelling of the Chemotherapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme”, I used computational modelling to study the interplay between DNA repair molecules and chemotherapeutic agents in brain tumours.
